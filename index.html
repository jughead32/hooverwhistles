					<h2>I'm Mac Hoover</h2>
					<p>
						My "signature sound" is quiet, but I make louder whistles, too. That
						typical Hoover sound is pure and sweet, but you can request it with
						just a hint of chiff. If you are looking for a whistle that you can
						play alone or with your friends without disturbing the neighbors,
						you've come to the right place.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>"Whitecap"</strong>, is my name for any one of my PVC or
						CPVC mouthpieces designed to be mated with a metal barrel of
						aluminum or brass of my making, or as a retrofit on any commercial
						whistle that has a lost, broken, or disappointing head.

							Without a doubt of all the soprano whistles I've tried over the
							years this one is the sweetest and most forgiving in the upper
							register, its a pleasure to play. Its also quite tactile, slim but
							with a nice weight to it. Excellent Whistle, excellent
							craftsmanship.

							I still can’t get over your traditional bore D brass whistle. It
							does sound so beautiful so unlike many other whistles. Today I
							played for couple of hours with it and feeling is amazing. Notes
							are so clear so free of any breathiness whatsoever.<br />

							"You need a different kind of breath control..."<br />

							"You don't blow...you just sort of breath into it" <br />

							" You can play at midnight and not disturb a soul." <br />

							"...definitely not for sessions.”

							The whistles arrived yesterday and I absolutely love them! The
							brass ones are like playing pure gold and I am especially enjoying
							the PVC low G. It sounds like it is made of wood, not PVC! I
							cannot get over how easily they go into the upper octave, and the
							beautiful tone they have! They make even an inexperienced player
							like me sound good! I am so thankful that our lives have touched.
							You have touched mine very deeply with your fine talent and your
							wonderful spirit! I will be in touch soon for my next
							purchase!--<strong>Cheryl</strong>

							Hi Mack, I got the whistle this afternoon, and it sounds
							beautiful! It's soft and sweet, just as I'd been told it would be
							(and this is just what an apartment-dweller wants). I really like
							the way the transition of a note from lower to higher octave is
							smooth and non-squeaky. It's hard to believe that my Feadog has
							become this amazing whistle. I expect to have many hours of
							enjoyable whistling. Doing business with you has been a pleasure,
							and I thank you for that. I'll get in touch with you the next time
							I'm in the market for a whistle again.<br />
							Thanks,<br />
							<strong>Sudarshan</strong>
