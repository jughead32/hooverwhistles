            <p>Without a doubt of all the soprano whistles I've tried over the years this one is the sweetest and most forgiving in the upper register, its a pleasure to play. Its also quite tactile, slim but with a nice weight to it. Excellent Whistle, excellent craftsmanship.</p>

            <p>I still can’t get over your traditional bore D brass whistle. It does sound so beautiful so unlike many other whistles. Today I played for couple of hours with it and feeling is amazing. Notes are so clear so free of any breathiness whatsoever.

                "You need a different kind of breath control..."
                
                "You don't blow...you just sort of breath into it" 
                
                " You can play at midnight and not disturb a soul." 
                
                "...definitely not for sessions.”</p>

            <p>... get a Hoover. Either the narrow bore D or the wide bore model. The narrow is by far the quietest game in town... tiny air requirements ...--Chuck Clark</p>

            <p>The whistles arrived yesterday and I absolutely love them!  The brass ones are like playing pure gold and I am especially enjoying  the PVC low G.   It sounds like it is made of wood, not PVC!  I cannot get over how easily they go into the upper octave, and the beautiful tone they have!  They make even an inexperienced player like me sound good!  I am so thankful that our lives have touched.  You have touched mine very deeply with your fine talent and your wonderful spirit!  I will be in touch soon for my next purchase!--Cheryl</p>

            <p>Hi Mack,

                I got the whistle this afternoon, and it sounds beautiful! It's soft and sweet, just as I'd been told it would be (and this is just what an apartment-dweller wants). I really like the way the transition of a note from lower to higher octave is smooth and non-squeaky. It's hard to believe that my Feadog has become this amazing whistle. I expect to have many hours of enjoyable whistling.
                
                Doing business with you has been a pleasure, and I thank you for that. I'll get in touch with you the next time I'm in the market for a whistle again.
                
                Thanks,
                
                Sudarshan</p>
